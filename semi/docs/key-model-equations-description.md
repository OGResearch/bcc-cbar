* Interest rate parity in real trends
* Long-run disparity term 

---

#### Foreign real short-term rate trend, FCY

## Local economy module

#### Aggregate demand equation

* Autoregressive process
* Response to expected future income
* Real short-rate effect (intertemporal substitution)
* Effect of lending conditions
* Real exchange rate effect (intratemporal expenditure switching in import and export)
* Foreign demand effect

---

#### Phillips curve

* Autoregressive process
* Short-term inflation expectations
* Domestic demand
* Indirect exchange rate pass-through
* Direct exchange rate pass-through


---

#### Short-term inflation expectations

* Partly model-consistent (forward-looking)
* Partly backward-looking

---

#### Monetary policy reaction function

* Inflation-targeting reaction function
* Autoregressive process: conservatism, uncertainty
* Response to domestic real economic activity
* Response to nominal exchange rate fluctuations


---

#### Fisher equation

* Define real interest rate

---

#### Uncovered interest parity

* Foreign exchange market
* Parity between local and foreign short rates with a premium: risk, capital controls 
* Remember to annualize the expected depreciation (the interest rates are annualized)
* Official interventions

---

#### Short-term exchange rate expectations

* Partly model-consistent (forward-looking)
* Partly backward-looking extrapolative

---

## World economy module
#### Foreign demand gap

* Autoregressive process
* Zero steady state


---

#### Short-term foreign rate, FCY

* Autoregressive process
* Steady state determined by the steady state parameters for the real rate and inflation

---

#### Foreign CPI inflation

* Autoregressive process
* Steady state parameterized
