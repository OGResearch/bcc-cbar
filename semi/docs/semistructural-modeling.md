for Central Bank of the Republic of Azerabaijan

----

## Outline of the model

* Semi-structural model framework

* Basic relationships between output, inflation, interest rates and exchange rate

* Designed for medium-term forecasting and medium-term policy analysis

* Monetary policy conduct: exchange rate management/targeting versus inflation targeting

* Extensions: T/NT, terms of trade



---

## What is semi-structural

* Balance between theoretical (logical) versus empirical (data) consistency

* No explicit microfoundations

* Explicit notions of demand and supply

* Endogenous model-consistent expectations

* Unobserved concepts


---

## Model building strategy

* Top down

* Large degree of separation of long-term trends and medium-term adjustment processes

* Well defined and well-controlled steady state

* "Behavioral" equations to describe dynamic convergence to steady state

* Backward and forward-looking "error correction" equations

* Core versus non-core dynamics

---

## Calibration

* Properties of the model as a whole system

* Critical policy properties

* Empirical validation exercises

* Never ending process

* Needs to be put in the context of the entire forecasting framework/process
