1. modelTnTOil.mod: The model file for 2-sector SOE with Oil Sector
2. modelTnTOil_steadystate.m: File that computes the steady state. 
Taking the guess on the sectoral price ratio with the help of (3) 
it solves the s.s.
3. fun_ss_helper.m: Helps (2) to solve for the steady state
4. compModels.m: compares IRFS for 2 versions of the model, plots and saves figures
You need to create 'mimages' subfolder to save thee output
5. simHere.m: The lighter veersion of (4). compares the model for differrent parameters.
Needs a sub-folder called 'images'
6. generateTex.m: generates a Latex file from saved figures
